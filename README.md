# Exercise on raft 

I'm experimenting with raft these days so to have a more hands on experience on distributed systems. This exercise follows the awesome tutorial provided by <https://notes.eatonphil.com/minimal-key-value-store-with-hashicorp-raft.html> i'm literally just copy-pasting it, which in itself is a consumer to hashicorp's raft implementation.
